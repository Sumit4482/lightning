- Professional UI/UX design consistent with the portfolio theme

## Features

### üé® Drawing Tools
- **Brush Size Control**: Adjustable brush size from 1px to 20px
- **Color Palette**: 12 predefined colors including the portfolio's accent colors
- **Real-time Drawing**: Smooth drawing experience with immediate visual feedback
- **Touch Support**: Full touch support for mobile devices

### üë• Collaboration Features
- **User Management**: See all active users with their names and colors
- **Real-time Status**: View who is currently drawing
- **User Avatars**: Color-coded user avatars for easy identification

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Angular 18 with TypeScript
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket simulation (ready for real server integration)
- **Canvas API**: HTML5 Canvas for drawing functionality
- **State Management**: RxJS Observables for reactive state management

### Key Components
1. **DrawingBoardComponent**: Main component handling canvas and user interface
2. **DrawingService**: Service managing WebSocket connections and drawing state
3. **Navigation Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the portfolio navigation

### File Structure
```
src/app/features/drawing-board/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drawing-board.component.html    # Template with drawing interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drawing-board.component.ts      # Component logic and canvas handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ drawing-board.component.scss    # Professional styling

src/app/core/services/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ drawing.service.ts              # WebSocket and drawing state management
```

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to the Drawing Board section (5th section in the portfolio)
2. Enter your name and select a color
3. Click "Start Drawing" to begin
4. Use the drawing tools on the left panel
5. Draw on the canvas in the center
6. View other users in the right panel

### Drawing Controls
- **Mouse/Touch**: Click and drag to draw
- **Brush Size**: Use the slider to adjust brush thickness
- **Colors**: Click on color circles to change drawing color
- **Clear**: Click the trash icon to clear the canvas
- **Download**: Click the download icon to save your drawing

## Future Enhancements

### Real WebSocket Server
The current implementation simulates WebSocket functionality. To make it fully collaborative:

1. **Set up a WebSocket server** (Node.js + Socket.IO recommended)
2. **Update the connection URL** in `drawing.service.ts`
3. **Implement server-side drawing synchronization**
4. **Add user authentication and room management**

### Additional Features
- **Multiple Rooms**: Create separate drawing sessions
- **Drawing History**: Undo/redo functionality
- **Shapes and Tools**: Add rectangles, circles, text tools
- **Layers**: Support for multiple drawing layers
- **Export Options**: SVG, PDF export formats
- **Collaboration Tools**: Chat, user cursors, drawing permissions

## Browser Support

- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Features**: Touch drawing, responsive design, canvas API

## Performance Considerations

- **Canvas Optimization**: Efficient redrawing algorithms
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of drawing strokes
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes
- **Touch Performance**: Smooth drawing on mobile devices

## Integration with Portfolio

The drawing board is fully integrated into the portfolio's design system:

- **Color Scheme**: Uses the same accent colors and theme
- **Typography**: Consistent with portfolio fonts
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with existing navigation dots
- **Responsive**: Adapts to the portfolio's responsive design

## Development Notes

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Running in Development
```bash
npm start
```

### Testing
The drawing board works in both development and production builds. The WebSocket simulation ensures functionality even without a real server.
