# Mobile Navigation Dots Overlap Fix

## Problem
On mobile devices, the navigation dots positioned on the right side were overlapping with project cards in the projects section, making them difficult to see and interact with. Additionally, when repositioned to the top-right corner, they conflicted with the color picker icon.

## Solution
Implemented dynamic positioning and z-index management for navigation dots on mobile devices, particularly when in the projects section. The dots are now positioned on the left side to avoid conflicts with the color picker.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Dots Component (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.ts`)
- Added mobile detection logic
- Added dynamic class generation based on current section
- Added resize event listener for responsive behavior
- Added `navigationClasses` getter for conditional styling

### 2. Navigation Dots Template (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.html`)
- Updated to use dynamic `[class]` binding instead of static class
- Now applies conditional classes based on mobile state and current section

### 3. Navigation Dots Styles (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.scss`)
- Added mobile-specific z-index reduction (500 instead of 1000)
- Added `.nav-dots-mobile-projects` class for projects section positioning
- Repositioned dots to top-left corner on mobile when in projects section
- Changed layout from vertical to horizontal on mobile for projects section
- Reduced dot size on mobile for projects section

### 4. Projects Section Styles (`src/app/features/projects/projects-section.component.scss`)
- Added `z-index: 1` to projects section
- Added `z-index: 2` to project cards
- Ensured proper layering hierarchy

## How It Works

### Mobile Detection
- Checks window width on component initialization
- Listens for resize events to update mobile state
- Uses 768px breakpoint for mobile detection

### Dynamic Positioning
- **Default (Desktop)**: Dots positioned vertically on right side, center
- **Mobile (Other Sections)**: Dots positioned vertically on right side, smaller size
- **Mobile (Projects Section)**: Dots repositioned to top-left corner, horizontal layout

### Z-Index Hierarchy
1. **Navigation Dots (Desktop)**: z-index 1000
2. **Navigation Dots (Mobile)**: z-index 500
3. **Navigation Dots (Mobile Projects)**: z-index 300
4. **Projects Section**: z-index 1
5. **Project Cards**: z-index 2

## Visual Changes

### Desktop
- No changes to existing behavior
- Navigation dots remain in original position

### Mobile (Other Sections)
- Smaller dot size (0.5rem vs 0.75rem)
- Reduced z-index to prevent overlap
- Closer to edge (1rem vs 2rem)

### Mobile (Projects Section)
- Dots moved to top-left corner (avoiding color picker on right)
- Horizontal layout instead of vertical
- Even smaller dots (0.4rem)
- Lower z-index to stay behind project cards

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the website on mobile or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
2. Navigate to the projects section
3. Verify navigation dots are positioned at top-left and don't overlap project cards or color picker
4. Test navigation between sections to ensure dots reposition correctly
5. Verify touch navigation still works properly

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Desktop browsers (no changes)
- ✅ Responsive design maintained

## Notes
- The solution maintains all existing functionality
- Touch navigation continues to work as implemented previously
- The fix is backward compatible with desktop layouts
- Z-index hierarchy ensures proper layering across all screen sizes
- Color picker remains accessible and doesn't conflict with navigation dots
