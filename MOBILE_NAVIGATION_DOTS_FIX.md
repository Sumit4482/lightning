# Mobile Navigation Dots Overlap Fix

## Problem
On mobile devices, the navigation dots positioned on the right side were overlapping with project cards in the projects section, making them difficult to see and interact with. Additionally, when repositioned to the top-right corner, they conflicted with the color picker icon.

## Solution
Implemented dynamic positioning and z-index management for navigation dots on mobile devices. The dots are now positioned in the top-left corner for all sections to avoid conflicts with other UI elements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Dots Component (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.ts`)
- Added mobile detection logic
- Added dynamic class generation based on device type
- Added resize event listener for responsive behavior
- Added `navigationClasses` getter for conditional styling

### 2. Navigation Dots Template (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.html`)
- Updated to use dynamic `[class]` binding instead of static class
- Now applies conditional classes based on mobile state

### 3. Navigation Dots Styles (`src/app/shared/components/navigation-dots/navigation-dots.component.scss`)
- Added mobile-specific z-index reduction (500 instead of 1000)
- Added `.nav-dots-mobile` class for mobile positioning
- Repositioned dots to top-left corner on mobile for all sections
- Changed layout from vertical to horizontal on mobile
- Reduced dot size on mobile

### 4. Projects Section Styles (`src/app/features/projects/projects-section.component.scss`)
- Added `z-index: 1` to projects section
- Added `z-index: 2` to project cards
- Ensured proper layering hierarchy

## How It Works

### Mobile Detection
- Checks window width on component initialization
- Listens for resize events to update mobile state
- Uses 768px breakpoint for mobile detection

### Dynamic Positioning
- **Default (Desktop)**: Dots positioned vertically on right side, center
- **Mobile (All Sections)**: Dots repositioned to top-left corner, horizontal layout

### Z-Index Hierarchy
1. **Navigation Dots (Desktop)**: z-index 1000
2. **Navigation Dots (Mobile)**: z-index 500
3. **Navigation Dots (Mobile All Sections)**: z-index 300
4. **Projects Section**: z-index 1
5. **Project Cards**: z-index 2

## Visual Changes

### Desktop
- No changes to existing behavior
- Navigation dots remain in original position

### Mobile (All Sections)
- Dots moved to top-left corner (avoiding color picker on right)
- Horizontal layout instead of vertical
- Smaller dots (0.4rem)
- Lower z-index to stay behind content

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the website on mobile or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
2. Navigate through all sections (Hero, About, Projects, Contact)
3. Verify navigation dots are positioned at top-left for all sections
4. Test navigation between sections to ensure dots work correctly
5. Verify touch navigation still works properly

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Desktop browsers (no changes)
- ✅ Responsive design maintained

## Notes
- The solution maintains all existing functionality
- Touch navigation continues to work as implemented previously
- The fix is backward compatible with desktop layouts
- Z-index hierarchy ensures proper layering across all screen sizes
- Color picker remains accessible and doesn't conflict with navigation dots
- Navigation dots are now consistently positioned for all sections on mobile
