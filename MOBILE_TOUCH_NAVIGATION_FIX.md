# Mobile Touch Navigation Fix

## Problem
The portfolio website was not responding to touch gestures on mobile devices. While wheel events worked fine on desktop/laptop trackpads, mobile devices use touch events instead of wheel events for navigation.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive touch event handling to support mobile navigation while maintaining existing desktop functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. App Component (`src/app/app.component.ts`)
- Added touch event listeners: `touchstart` and `touchend`
- Implemented swipe detection with configurable thresholds:
  - `SWIPE_THRESHOLD`: 50px minimum distance for a swipe
  - `SWIPE_TIME_THRESHOLD`: 300ms maximum time for a swipe
- Added touch coordinates tracking and timing
- Integrated with existing `NavigationService` for section navigation

### 2. Global Styles (`src/styles.scss`)
- Added `touch-action: pan-y` to `html`, `body`, and `.portfolio-container`
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth iOS scrolling
- Ensured proper touch gesture handling

### 3. App Component Styles (`src/app/app.component.scss`)
- Added `touch-action: pan-y` to portfolio container
- Added mobile-specific touch feedback styles
- Removed tap highlight color for cleaner mobile experience
- Added subtle touch feedback for interactive elements

### 4. Projects Section (`src/app/features/projects/projects-section.component.scss`)
- Added `touch-action: pan-x` to projects grid for horizontal scrolling
- Ensured project carousel doesn't interfere with main navigation

## How It Works

### Touch Detection
1. **Touch Start**: Records initial touch position and timestamp
2. **Touch End**: Calculates swipe distance and duration
3. **Validation**: Checks if swipe meets minimum distance and maximum time thresholds
4. **Navigation**: Triggers section navigation based on swipe direction

### Swipe Directions
- **Swipe Up** (positive distance): Navigate to next section
- **Swipe Down** (negative distance): Navigate to previous section

### Thresholds
- **Distance**: Minimum 50px swipe distance required
- **Time**: Maximum 300ms swipe duration (prevents accidental swipes)

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Desktop browsers (wheel events still work)
- ✅ Touch-enabled laptops (both wheel and touch events work)

## Testing
To test the mobile navigation:
1. Open the website on a mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
2. Swipe up/down on the screen to navigate between sections
3. Verify that the navigation dots update accordingly
4. Test that the projects section horizontal scrolling still works

## Notes
- The touch navigation respects the same scrolling cooldown as wheel events
- Horizontal touch gestures in the projects section are preserved
- All existing keyboard navigation (arrow keys) continues to work
- The solution is backward compatible with desktop wheel events
