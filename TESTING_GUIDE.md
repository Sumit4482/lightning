# üß™ Testing Guide - Real-time Drawing Board

## ‚úÖ **Backend Status: WORKING**
- **URL**: `https://portfolio-production-5aea.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
- **WebSocket**: ‚úÖ Ready for connections

## üß™ **Step-by-Step Testing**

### **1. Backend Testing (Already Verified)**

```bash
# Health check - should return JSON
curl https://portfolio-production-5aea.up.railway.app/api/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "users": 0,
  "strokes": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T11:03:20.390Z"
}
```

### **2. Frontend Testing**

#### **Option A: Test Locally**
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Open browser to: http://localhost:4200
```

#### **Option B: Test Production Build**
```bash
# Serve the built files
npx http-server dist/lightning -p 8080

# Open browser to: http://localhost:8080
```

### **3. Drawing Board Testing**

#### **Step 1: Navigate to Drawing Board**
1. Open your portfolio
2. Navigate to the **Drawing Board** section (5th dot)
3. You should see the connection modal

#### **Step 2: Connect to Server**
1. Enter your name (e.g., "TestUser")
2. Select a color
3. Click "Start Drawing"
4. Check connection status (should show "Connected" with green wifi icon)

#### **Step 3: Test Drawing Features**
1. **Basic Drawing**: Click and drag on canvas
2. **Color Change**: Select different colors
3. **Brush Size**: Adjust the brush size slider
4. **Clear Canvas**: Click the trash icon
5. **Download**: Click download to save your drawing

#### **Step 4: Test Real-time Collaboration**
1. **Open Multiple Tabs**: Open your portfolio in 2-3 browser tabs
2. **Join with Different Names**: Each tab with a different name
3. **Draw Simultaneously**: Draw in one tab, see it appear in others
4. **User List**: Check that all users appear in the right panel
5. **User Status**: Verify "Drawing..." status when someone is drawing

### **4. Browser Console Testing**

Open browser console (F12) and check for:

#### **‚úÖ Success Messages:**
```
Connected to drawing server
User joined: [username]
Drawing stroke received
```

#### **‚ùå Error Messages to Watch For:**
```
Connection error: [error details]
WebSocket connection failed
```

### **5. Network Testing**

In browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:

#### **‚úÖ Successful Connections:**
- WebSocket connection to `wss://portfolio-production-5aea.up.railway.app`
- HTTP requests to health endpoint
- No CORS errors

#### **‚ùå Issues to Check:**
- Failed WebSocket connections
- CORS errors
- 404/500 errors

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Connection Fails:**

1. **Check Server URL**
   ```typescript
   // In drawing.service.ts
   const serverUrl = 'https://portfolio-production-5aea.up.railway.app';
   ```

2. **Check Railway Status**
   ```bash
   cd server
   railway status
   railway logs
   ```

3. **Test Server Health**
   ```bash
   curl https://portfolio-production-5aea.up.railway.app/api/health
   ```

### **If Drawing Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check Canvas Context**
   - Ensure canvas is properly initialized
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

2. **Check WebSocket Events**
   - Verify 'drawing-stroke' events are being sent/received
   - Check for connection status

### **If Real-time Collaboration Fails:**

1. **Check Multiple Users**
   - Ensure different user names
   - Check user list updates

2. **Check Network**
   - Verify WebSocket connections
   - Check for connection drops
