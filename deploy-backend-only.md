# 🚀 Deploy Backend Only (Frontend on Netlify)

## Current Setup
- ✅ **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify
- 🔄 **Backend**: Need to deploy WebSocket server

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Make sure your code is on GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add WebSocket server for drawing board"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Create New Project**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repository**

### Step 3: Configure Server
In Railway dashboard:
- **Root Directory**: `server`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Step 4: Get Your Server URL
After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app.railway.app`

### Step 5: Update Frontend
Edit `src/app/core/services/drawing.service.ts`:
```typescript
// Change this line:
const serverUrl = 'https://your-app.railway.app'; // Your Railway URL
```

### Step 6: Redeploy Frontend
```bash
# Build and deploy to Netlify
npm run build
# Upload dist/lightning to Netlify
```

## Option 2: Render (Completely Free)

### Step 1: Go to Render
1. Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"

### Step 2: Connect Repository
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set **Root Directory** to: `server`
3. Set **Build Command** to: `npm install`
4. Set **Start Command** to: `npm start`

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Wait for deployment
3. Get your URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

### Step 4: Update Frontend
```typescript
const serverUrl = 'https://your-app.onrender.com';
```

## Option 3: Railway CLI (Command Line)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Initialize and deploy
railway init
railway up

# Get your URL
railway status
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these in your deployment platform:

**Railway:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**Render:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

### CORS Settings
Update `server/drawing-server.js` for production:
```javascript
cors: {
  origin: "https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app", // Your Netlify URL
  methods: ["GET", "POST"]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Test Server Health
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "users": 0,
  "strokes": 0,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

### 2. Test Frontend Connection
1. Open your Netlify app
2. Navigate to Drawing Board
3. Try connecting with a username
4. Check browser console for connection status

### 3. Test Real-time Features
1. Open multiple browser tabs
2. Join with different names
3. Start drawing
4. Verify real-time collaboration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Check server URL in frontend
   - Verify CORS settings
   - Check deployment logs

2. **WebSocket Not Connecting**
   - Ensure server supports WebSocket
   - Check firewall/network settings
   - Verify SSL certificates

3. **Build Errors**
   - Check package.json dependencies
   - Verify Node.js version
   - Check deployment logs

### Debug Steps:
1. **Check server logs** in Railway/Render dashboard
2. **Test server health** endpoint
3. **Check browser console** for errors
4. **Verify CORS settings**
